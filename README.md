# hitting406's source code

There's not any backend code here, so I've decided to host it as a public repository since any cunning individual could rip off all of the code anyways.  

Kudos to [Tom Preston Warner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) for his work on Jekyll, from which this site's markup is generated.  I didn't fork his personal source, but did use a few portions of his website as a foundation of this site.
