I just noticed something when making out an address on an envelope: 

My handwriting has regressed to a level equal or perhaps lower than its quality in grade school.

There are so few tasks these days that require hand-written skills, that I doubt this is an uncommon occurrence.  I would venture to say that perhaps the most common handwriting these days is in college students taking notes and note taking in meetings-- though even in those instances, it is becoming much more common to carry laptops to the office or lecture halls.

As laptop prices continue to drop, and ipads and other tablets make their way into even grade schools, schools might choose (and perhaps intelligently so) to focus all of their attention on typing skills instead of handwriting skills.  I would argue that typing skills are far more valuable in the marketplace these days than handwriting anyways.
  
Without the foundation of penmanship courses (do schools even do this anymore?), children won't even learn the foundation of hand writing skills to maintain the legacy of notes, hand written letters and the like.  With a generation with paltry writing skills, there will be even more demand on digital services, which will eventually replace even the most trivial of tasks that used to be handled with a pen and a few scribbles.

And then, maybe in another hundred years, handwriting will be regulated only to a sort of retro-artistic movement.  We'll admire old hand written letters and marvel at the antiquity of pen and paper only from within protected cases at museums.

With handwritings' imminent demise, I wonder how long it will take until common typing on keyboards is revolutionized.  New touchscreens already offer "swiping" words instead of having to hit each key, and voice recognition software makes even swiping seem arduous.

And yet with each technological revolution, each step of progress towards total technological efficiency, I can't help but feel that we're becoming more and more disconnected from our traditional sense of what makes each of us unique and human.
