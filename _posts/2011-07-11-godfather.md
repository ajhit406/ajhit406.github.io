This quote from The Godfather II is a great example of why it is startups who disrupt industries. There are few things stronger than passion and the will to succeed.

> MICHAEL: I saw an interesting thing happen today. A rebel was being arrested by the military police, and rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had hidden in his jacket. He killed himself, and took a captain of the command with him.

>[ROTH looks concerned]

>JOHNNY OLA: Those rebels, you know, they're lunatics.
>
>MICHAEL: Maybe so -- but it occurred to me. The soldiers are paid to fight -- the rebels aren't.

>ROTH: What does that tell you?
>
>MICHAEL: **They can win.**
