title: 2 Reasons I Don't Work for Facebook
---

A couple weeks ago, I met up with some old friends to watch Arizona [crush Harvard's exciting, but brief NCAA dreams](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1579129-harvard-vs-arizona-recap-stats-and-box-score). As Harvard's shots clanked off the rim and they scrambled to defend a superior Arizona offense, I regaled my friends with stories of scrappy entrepreneurship. After a few minutes, one of my friends, furrowed his drunken brow and asked quizzically:

> "Why even start your own company? Why not just work for Facebook? Those places look sweet and you could have probably retired by now."

It's a good question, one a lot of entrepreneurs ask themselves when they're in the deepest depths of the [trough of sorrow](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/03/the-startup-curve.html). After a second of reflection, my [delusion](http://hitting406.com/2012/07/01/delusion.html) kicked back into gear. I've always known the answer.

> "I want to be the guy who creates the lightbulb, not the guy who makes it brighter."

That, and I don't think they'd ever hire me.
