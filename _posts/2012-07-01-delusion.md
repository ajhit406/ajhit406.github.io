title: Entrepreneurial delusion
---

I recently read a [mind blowing article](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/get-ready-because-voyager-i-is-this-close-to-leaving-our-solar-system/258456/) about Voyager I, the 35 year-old space probe that is on the cusp of becoming the first man-made object to exit the solar system.

The irony of this event, as the article points out, is that we cannot tell exactly *when* voyager has reached interstellar space, because, well, nothing has ever been there before. There is no historical event that would help prove it has crossed the outer boundary of our solar system because we really don't know where that line exists.

Being an entrepreneur is facscinating because we are all a little like Voyager I, in that we operate in the outer boundaries of our own reality. We are constantly inventing new and better ways to work, to live, to interact. In effect, we are our own Makers-- constantly expanding and redefining reality for ourselves and those around us.

What differentiates entrepreneurs from Voyager I is that Voyager I is simply along for the ride. It is a passive observer of space over time. Alternatively, entrepreneurs are directly responsible for defining our own new realities as we move ever forward; shaping each new hardware device and software application in our own conceived image of the future.

Often, entrepreneurs who consistently define new trends are  referred to as prophets or visionaries. Interestingly, visionaries are often regarded as *delusional* until their theory, product or service has acheieved mass adoption.

So then perhaps a prerequisite of becoming a successful entpreneur is having the courage to be an outcast, a heretic, a deluded, crazy person. Go against the grain. Dream of a bigger, better world. Then go out and create it.

I'll leave you with my favorite passage from [Walter Isaacson's biography on Steve Jobs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451648537/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1451648537&linkCode=as2&tag=hitting406-20):

>Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, “A faster horse!” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

>I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company which is the hardest work in the business. That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will stand for something a generation or two from now.
