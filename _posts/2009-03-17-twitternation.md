I really like twitter.

 Facebook sometimes seems to be a victim of its own success. Its trying to please too many people and isnt focusing on its core services-- even though mark has dictated that is its mission in the past (http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/07/interview-with-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-products-funding-competition/). Maybe this is true, and in essence focusing on refining the feeds, facebook connect, and iPhone integration are likely considered "core" services. But what about the actual features that people use daily? Photos, inbox, status?

More and more I'm realizing however, that twitter does what I need for my daily social consumption. A picture here and there, a small status update, a link. I dont really need the preview, I trust who I'm following. Not to mention, most of the things that my college and highschool friends post isn't always incredibly interesting.

Facebook still owns the "album" sphere, by virtue of their social tagging infrastructure. It's great, and probably wont be replaced for a long, long time. Plus, I'm not arguing that facebook isn't the obvious owner of the social graph. This post isn't meant to take anything away from Facebook; but to appreciate the value of simplicity.

Facebooks owns my social graph. Twitter owns my interest graph. They're different, and perhaps, equally valuable. Depends on my mood, I guess.
