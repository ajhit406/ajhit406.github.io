# {{ page.title }}

I like designing for mobile interfaces, because each screen is an exercise in minimalism. Generally, I follow a self-proclaimed rule of 3:

Pick **3 elements** that fit into one of three main content areas:

* Actions / Navigation
* Information / Text
* Visuals / Branding

Picking which elements make the cut is a fun exercise. If I'm doing a redesign instead of designing a new site, I have a wealth of analytics and SEO data that I can use to prioritize elements both on the full and mobile sites. 

## Google Webmaster Tools

First, I use [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en) to estimate things people are looking for most on the site. Because Google is a Demand Fulfillment Engine, it is a *natural design filter*. 

Common search terms can help you determine which navigation elements or information elements to prioritize. For instance, if you're designing a website for a restaurant, you probably want to prioritize your design to fulfill common searches from potential customers:

* "Where is [Restaurant]"
* "When is [Restaurant] open?"
* "What is the [Restaurant] menu?"
* ("What does [Restaurant] look like?")

If you're a restaurant owner, and you're answering those things on your homepage clearly, then you're ahead of the curve. 

After looking at common search queries generating leads to the site, I switch over to [Google Analytics](www.google.com/analytics) and look at the most visited pages on the site. This statistic can be skewed a bit if the site was previously poorly constructed, but is generally a good indicator of the most important pages. 

* /reservations
* /locate-us
* /menu

If you're operating a restaurant website, you're probably going to see something similar to the above. Really, predicting these search queries is often just an exercise in: "Hey, I'm a human, how would I find a good place to eat using the internetâ€¦". 

## Google Keyword Tool

If you're designing your site and don't have access to historical SEO and analytics data, you can utilize the [Google Adwords Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer) to estimate common search terms within your vertical. This usually yields interesting results and can elucidate some interesting and important design decisions.  

## Demand Fulfillment

In the end, good product design is about fulfilling user demand quickly and directly. Include the things users want to see, and remove the things they don't. Luckily, with SEO and Google Analytics Data, they're already telling you what they want. 

Google is our modern day demand fulfillment engine. Facebook is our Demand Generation engine. In the coming decade, these sites will continue to define and shape how we consume information. I believe that site's that expose important data in clean, standardized formats will gain a significant advantage.  

Movements like [Microformats](http://microformats.org/) and [Facebook's Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) will therefore guide much of the design principles with an increasily [semantic foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).  

Philisophically, most open-web enthusiats would prefer mainstream adoption of open Microformat standards vs. the proprietary and walled-garden approach of Facebook's OpenGraph. In practice however, the proprietary approach offers the most significant economic opportunity and will likely prevail (FB OG).
