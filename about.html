  <figcaption>This red seat signifies the longest home run ever hit at Fenway Park. The Ted Williams hit on June 9, 1946, was officially measured at 502 feet (153 m)â€” well beyond "Williamsburg". According to Hit Tracker Online, the ball, if unobstructed, would have flown 520 to 535 feet (160 to 163 m).</figcaption>
