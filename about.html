<h1>about</h1>

<p>This site's title refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Williams" title="Ted Williams Wikipedia" target="_blank">Ted Williams'</a> feat of <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/p_wilt5.shtml" title="Hitting 406 on Baseball Almanac" target="_blank">attaining a .406 batting average</a> for the Boston Red Sox in 1941. For the uneducated, a batting average signifies how often a player is expected to hit safely during an at-bat.</p>

<p>Hitting over .400 is an extremely rare feat. In fact, Williams' average in 1941 was the last time a Major League player has hit that mark.</p>

<h3>Focus, Consistency  &amp; Confidence</h3>

<p>The baseball season is over 160 games long. Games are physically and mentally tiring; often lasting over 4 hours. To maintain extreme focus for so many games over the course of the season without succumbing to injury or mental fatigue is near impossible.</p>

<p>Most of life is the same. The entrepreneur must meet every challenge with an exceptional amount of vigor. The successful entrepreneur must out-think, out-train and out-perform the competition. They must do this everyday, without fail. When they do fail, which they inevitably will, they must pick themselves up, dust themselves off, learn from their failures and continue to move forward.</p>

<p>Before the last game of 1941, Ted Williams batting average stood at .39955. According to the league statisticians, his average would be rounded up and he was guaranteed to record a .400 average without playing the final game. Williams, however, decided to play as he didn't feel he deserved to be recognized for his accomplishment if he sat out the final game. He ended up batting 6-for-8 for the day, and finished the season with an average of .406</p>

<p>Like any successful ballplayer, entrepreneurs must be confident with their ability to make the right decisions and to guide their company forward -- adapting as they encounter the occasional curveball.</p>

<p>The lone red seat in the right field bleachers (Section 42, Row 37, Seat 21) signifies the longest home run ever hit at Fenway. The Ted Williams hit on June 9, 1946, was officially measured at 502 feet (153 m)â€” well beyond "Williamsburg". According to Hit Tracker Online, the ball, if unobstructed, would have flown 520 to 535 feet (160 to 163 m).</p>
<p>The ball landed on Joseph A. Boucher, penetrating his large straw hat and hitting him in the head. A confounded Boucher was later quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>How far away must one sit to be safe in this park? I didn't even get the ball. They say it bounced a dozen rows higher, but after it hit my head, I was no longer interested. I couldn't see the ball. Nobody could. The sun was right in our eyes. All we could do was duck. I'm glad I did not stand up.</blockquote>
