<h1>about</h1>

<p>I'm interested in design, technology, baseball, economics, microbreweries, physics and philosophy (in no particular order).</p>

<p>I'm currently building a cloud development platform called <a href="http://nitrous.io">nitrous.io</a>.</p>

<p>The name of this site is derived from one of the most remarkable accomplishments in the history of sport: Ted Williams' <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/p_wilt5.shtml" title="Hitting 406 on Baseball Almanac" target="_blank">.406 batting average</a> for the Boston Red Sox in 1941.</p>

  <figcaption>This red seat marks the longest home run ever hit at Fenway Park. The home run Ted Williams hit on June 9, 1946, was officially measured at 502 feet (153 m). According to Hit Tracker Online, the ball, if unobstructed, would have flown 520 to 535 feet (160 to 163 m).</figcaption>
